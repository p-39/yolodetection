#Object Detection using YOLO#
Object Detection and Tracking using YOLO and OpenCV
This project implements real-time object detection and tracking using the YOLOv3 algorithm combined with OpenCV. It can detect multiple objects in a video stream and track them across frames using a tracking algorithm, providing robust performance for a variety of applications.

Features
Real-time object detection with YOLOv3.
Works with video files.

Technologies Used
C++: Core language for building the application.
OpenCV: For image processing, DNN integration, and object tracking.
YOLOv3: Pre-trained deep learning model for object detection.
CMake: Build system for managing dependencies and project compilation.
